TO-DO:

- add a play button at top; record voice reading whole piece

- make each stanza clickable to play recording of me reading each

- adjust position and order of images to create more pleasing and dynamic flow

- make mobile layout nicer and mobile font big enough for children to interact with

- change unicode emoticons to SVGs so they don't show up as normal looking emojis on mobile

- make images play recordings of more abstract sounds when clicked (perhaps rip sounds from youtube, etc?)


- dark mode button? ooo....(JS for this? or just a different html file?)


DONE:

- figured out why font isnt showing up off of my laptop
- added backup font families
